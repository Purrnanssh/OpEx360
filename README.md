# OpEx360 — Operational Efficiency & Cost Reduction Dashboard

**Stack:** Python (pandas) · SQL · Power BI

---

## TL;DR
OpEx360 is an end-to-end operational analytics solution that processes raw operations logs, extracts KPI metrics (SLA compliance, cost per transaction, cycle time), and visualizes them in an interactive Power BI dashboard to reveal cost-saving and efficiency opportunities. In example data, the analysis surfaced **~12% potential cost savings** and **~15% faster workflow execution** through process improvements and what-if scenarios.

---

## Why this project
Operational teams produce large volumes of event logs but often lack a consistent, data-driven process to measure bottlenecks and quantify cost impact. OpEx360 fills that gap by:
- converting raw logs into actionable KPIs,
- detecting process bottlenecks and SLA breaches,
- enabling scenario analysis to evaluate cost reduction strategies.

---

## Highlights / Outcomes
- Cleaned and transformed operations logs into a single canonical dataset.  
- Key KPIs: SLA Compliance, Cost per Transaction, Cycle Time, Cost per Second.  
- Dashboard features: KPI summary, trend analysis, department × step heatmap, bottleneck detection, what-if cost scenarios.  
- Example result: identification of ~12% cost savings opportunity and ~15% faster execution by addressing top bottlenecks.
